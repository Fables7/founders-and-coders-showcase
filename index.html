            <p>
              My Name is Fabien Lestrat, as a skilled front-end developer with a
              strong foundation in JavaScript, I have developed a keen eye for
              design and user experience. I have confidence in my ability to
              produce well-designed, user-friendly web apps that meet and
              surpass client expectations. Although concentrating mostly on
              front-end programming, I have taken courses and worked on projects
              to improve my back-end development abilities using
              Node.js,vMongoDB, and Express.js.

            <h1>Why Web Developing?</h1>
            <p>
              My career in web development began just over 2 years ago when I
              gained an interest in building applications after seeing all the
              amazing things that can be done with code, especially all the
              useful applications that we use every day. I have always been
              interested in technology and how it works, so I decided to take
              courses in web development. I have been hooked ever since. I love
              the challenge of creating something from nothing and seeing the
              final product. I am always looking to learn new things and improve
              my skills. Despite the experience I have gained over the last 2
              years, I know that I have a lot more to learn, and that is why I
              want to enroll into this apprenticeship, to improve my abilities
              and ensure I can be the best that I can be..

            <h1>Styling</h1>
            <p>
              When I initially started incorporating styling into my web and
              mobile apps, I began by using React's stylesheet. Although it was
              a valid approach for applying styles, I found it cumbersome as it
              increased the size of each file and made the code appear
              disorganized. To address this, I adopted the use of CSS modules.
              By utilizing separate files for each CSS module, I could scope
              styles to individual components, resulting in cleaner and more
              organized code. However, this approach limited me to plain CSS,
              lacking programmable features like loops and functions. To
              overcome this limitation, I transitioned to CSS-in-JS libraries
              like styled-components. I greatly preferred this method as it
              empowered me with the full capabilities of JavaScript, enabling
              programmable features and dynamic styles based on state. More
              recently, while developing web apps with React and Next.js, I
              discovered a utility class library called tailwindcss. Utilizing
              tailwindcss provided several benefits. It allowed me to write
              styling using utility classes in a much shorter and more efficient
              manner compared to regular plain CSS. Additionally, it
              automatically purges any unused CSS, resulting in highly optimized
              bundle sizes.

            <h1>Frontend</h1>
            <p>
              I started my web development journey by teaching myself
              JavaScript, and then I moved on to learning React. Most of the
              courses I took were from Udemy, and I found them really helpful.
              They provided me with a lot of useful information and taught me
              well. Surprisingly, I was able to understand JavaScript quite well
              in just a few months, even though I hadn't worked with it before
              (although I did have some experience with Python in school). Once
              I finished learning JavaScript, I quickly started learning React,
              which is now the main framework I use for my projects. React was a
              bit challenging for me at first because there were many new
              concepts to learn, and I got stuck a few times during the learning
              process. However, I was able to figure things out by working on
              practical projects and building small applications. Some of the
              important things I learned in React include managing state using
              useState and useContext, using libraries like Redux, and using
              hooks and other React libraries like React Navigation and Next.js.

            <h1>Backend</h1>

            <p>
              I chose to learn backend development using the MERN stack because
              it perfectly complemented my frontend skills. Since both the
              frontend and backend in the MERN stack use React, it was a natural
              fit for me. The MERN stack includes MongoDB, Express.js, React,
              and Node.js, which together provide a powerful framework for web
              applications. By using the MERN stack, I could apply my existing
              knowledge of React to the server-side and build full-stack
              applications with ease.
