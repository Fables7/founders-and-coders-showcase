            <p>
              My Name is Fabien Lestrat, as a skilled front-end developer with a
              strong foundation in JavaScript, I have developed a keen eye for
              design and user experience. I have confidence in my ability to
              produce well-designed, user-friendly web apps that meet and
              surpass client expectations. Although concentrating mostly on
              front-end programming, I have taken courses and worked on projects
              to improve my back-end development abilities using
              Node.js,vMongoDB, and Express.js.

            <h1>Why Web Developing?</h1>
            <p>
              My career in web development began just over 2 years ago when I
              gained an interest in building applications after seeing all the
              amazing things that can be done with code, especially all the
              useful applications that we use every day. I have always been
              interested in technology and how it works, so I decided to take
              courses in web development. I have been hooked ever since. I love
              the challenge of creating something from nothing and seeing the
              final product. I am always looking to learn new things and improve
              my skills. Despite the experience I have gained over the last 2
              years, I know that I have a lot more to learn, and that is why I
              want to enroll into this apprenticeship, to improve my abilities
              and ensure I can be the best that I can be..
