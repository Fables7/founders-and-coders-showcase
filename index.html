            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
              My Name is Fabien Lestrat, as a skilled front-end developer with a
              strong foundation in JavaScript, I have developed a keen eye for
              design and user experience. I have confidence in my ability to
              produce well-designed, user-friendly web apps that meet and
              surpass client expectations. Although concentrating mostly on
              front-end programming, I have taken courses and worked on projects
              to improve my back-end development abilities using
              Node.js,vMongoDB, and Express.js.

            <h1>Why Web Developing?</h1>
            <p>
              My career in web development began just over 2 years ago when I
              gained an interest in building applications after seeing all the
              amazing things that can be done with code, especially all the
              useful applications that we use every day. I have always been
              interested in technology and how it works, so I decided to take
              courses in web development. I have been hooked ever since. I love
              the challenge of creating something from nothing and seeing the
              final product. I am always looking to learn new things and improve
              my skills. Despite the experience I have gained over the last 2
              years, I know that I have a lot more to learn, and that is why I
              want to enroll into this apprenticeship, to improve my abilities
              and ensure I can be the best that I can be.

                <img src="public/Stylings-logo.png" class="logos right" />
                <p>
                  When I initially started incorporating styling into my web and
                  mobile apps, I began by using React's stylesheet. Although it
                  was a valid approach for applying styles, I found it
                  cumbersome as it increased the size of each file and made the
                  code appear disorganized. To address this, I adopted the use
                  of CSS modules. By utilizing separate files for each CSS
                  module, I could scope styles to individual components,
                  resulting in cleaner and more organized code. However, this
                  approach limited me to plain CSS, lacking programmable
                  features like loops and functions. To overcome this
                  limitation, I transitioned to CSS-in-JS libraries like
                  styled-components. I greatly preferred this method as it
                  empowered me with the full capabilities of JavaScript,
                  enabling programmable features and dynamic styles based on
                  state. More recently, while developing web apps with React and
                  Next.js, I discovered a utility class library called
                  tailwindcss. Utilizing tailwindcss provided several benefits.
                  It allowed me to write styling using utility classes in a much
                  shorter and more efficient manner compared to regular plain
                  CSS. Additionally, it automatically purges any unused CSS,
                  resulting in highly optimized bundle sizes.

                  I started my web development journey by teaching myself
                  JavaScript, and then I moved on to learning React. Most of the
                  courses I took were from Udemy, and I found them really
                  helpful. They provided me with a lot of useful information and
                  taught me well. Surprisingly, I was able to understand
                  JavaScript quite well in just a few months, even though I
                  hadn't worked with it before (although I did have some
                  experience with Python in school). Once I finished learning
                  JavaScript, I quickly started learning React, which is now the
                  main framework I use for my projects. React was a bit
                  challenging for me at first because there were many new
                  concepts to learn, and I got stuck a few times during the
                  learning process. However, I was able to figure things out by
                  working on practical projects and building small applications.
                  Some of the important things I learned in React include
                  managing state using useState and useContext, using libraries
                  like Redux, and using hooks and other React libraries like
                  React Navigation and Next.js.

              <div class="content animate-right content-right">

                <p>
                  I chose to learn backend development using the MERN stack
                  because it perfectly complemented my frontend skills. Since
                  both the frontend and backend in the MERN stack use React, it
                  was a natural fit for me. The MERN stack includes MongoDB,
                  Express.js, React, and Node.js, which together provide a
                  powerful framework for web applications. By using the MERN
                  stack, I could apply my existing knowledge of React to the
                  server-side and build full-stack applications with ease.
